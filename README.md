A curated [Awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) list of Flax Game Engine resources. The engine, still being in it's early state, doesn't have an enormous amount of resources from community efforts yet, and many of the github resources will likely be from FlaxEngine themselves.

## Contribution
This is a work in progress list initially aimed at my own usage of the engine, and as such I'll be testing addons and tools as I dive into projects with them. Your mileage may vary on usability, and some of these may be older plugins for previous iterations of the engine.  I don't personally make any compatibility promises, but will note when I find compatibility tips, needed workarounds, etc.
If contributing, try to be as informative and collaboratively minded as possible, not just PR a random link with no info. If you'd like to contribute new or newly found links, repositories, tools, or resources, feel free to ***create a pull request***
