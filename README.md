# Awesome Flax [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge-flat2.svg)](https://awesome.re)

![logo_512](https://github.com/kacevoid/awesome-flax/assets/27834580/588296fe-03bf-4037-97b3-e2531cc0d31e)

## What this is
A curated [Awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) list of Flax Game Engine resources. Becuase Flax is awesome.

This is meant to be an **entry point for new users** of the engine outside of the existing Discord and Forum ecosystems, in order to bring in more devs. If you want to know, "can Flax do x?" this hopefully is a good starting point. And if you want to contribute, you should be able to find a niche.

## What Flax is
[FlaxEngine](https://github.com/FlaxEngine/FlaxEngine) is a (pretty much exclusively) 3D Game Engine with a rich variety of features, and a **recent move to Open Source** and much more collaboritive **MIT License**. This puts it in a position of being a modern, modular, small, and _fast_ replacement for Unity like engines with viable community input and expansion.

## Contribution
This is a work in progress list initially aimed at my own usage of the engine, which I am fairly new to myself, and as such I'll be testing addons and tools as I dive into projects with them. Your mileage may vary on usability, and some of these may be older plugins for previous iterations of the engine.  I don't personally make any compatibility promises, but will note when I find compatibility tips, needed workarounds, etc. If you make a fresh branch of an older tool and update it, PR it.

Many of the initial links come from the Discord, A Forum once-over, and Github searches.

If you'd like to **contribute** new or newly found links, repositories, tools, or resources, feel free to ***create a pull request***
