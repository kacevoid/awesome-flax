## What this is
A curated [Awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) list of Flax Game Engine resources. This is meant to be an entry point for new users of the engine. If you want to know, "can it do x?" this hopefully is a good starting point.

The engine, still being in it's early state, doesn't have a large amount of resources from community efforts yet, and many of the github resources will likely be from FlaxEngine themselves.

## What Flax is
[FlaxEngine](https://github.com/FlaxEngine/FlaxEngine) is a (pretty much exclusively) 3D Game Engine with a rich variety of features, and a **recent move to Open Source** and much more collaboritive **MIT License**. This puts it in a position of being a modern, modular, small, and _fast_ replacement for Unity like engines with viable community input and expansion.

## Contribution
This is a work in progress list initially aimed at my own usage of the engine, which I am fairly new to myself, and as such I'll be testing addons and tools as I dive into projects with them. Your mileage may vary on usability, and some of these may be older plugins for previous iterations of the engine.  I don't personally make any compatibility promises, but will note when I find compatibility tips, needed workarounds, etc. If you make a fresh branch of an older tool and update it, PR it.

If you'd like to **contribute** new or newly found links, repositories, tools, or resources, feel free to ***create a pull request***
